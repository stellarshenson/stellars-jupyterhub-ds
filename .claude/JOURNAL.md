# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - Add Docker badges**: added Docker pulls and GitHub stars badges to README.md<br>
    **Result**: README now displays Docker pulls badge (stellars/stellars-jupyterhub-ds), Docker image size badge, and GitHub stars badge

2. **Task - Project initialization and documentation**: Analyzed codebase and created comprehensive project documentation<br>
    **Result**: Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with detailed architecture overview, configuration patterns, common commands, GPU auto-detection logic, volume management, authentication setup, and troubleshooting guide for future Claude Code instances

3. **Task - Feature planning for user controls**: Designed two self-service features for JupyterHub user control panel<br>
    **Result**: Created `FEATURE_PLAN.md` documenting Reset Home Volume and Restart Server features with implementation details, API handlers, UI templates, JavaScript integration, security considerations, edge cases, testing plans, and rollout strategy

4. **Task - Version management implementation**: Added version tracking and tagging system matching stellars-jupyterlab-ds pattern<br>
    **Result**: Created `project.env` with project metadata and version 1.0.0_jh-4.x, updated `Makefile` with increment_version and tag targets, auto-increment on build, dual-tag push (latest and versioned), leveraging existing Docker socket access for both planned features

5. **Task - Implement user self-service features**: Implemented Reset Home Volume and Restart Server features from FEATURE_PLAN.md<br>
    **Result**: Created custom API handlers in `services/jupyterhub/conf/bin/custom_handlers.py` with ResetHomeVolumeHandler and RestartServerHandler classes, created custom `home.html` template with buttons and confirmation modals, registered handlers in `jupyterhub_config.py` with @admin_or_self permissions, updated Dockerfile to copy templates and handlers, added feature documentation to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - both features use Docker API directly via /var/run/docker.sock for volume management and container restart operations

6. **Task - Enhance and fix self-service features**: Evolved volume management from single home volume to multi-volume selection, fixed Bootstrap 5 compatibility, added visual enhancements<br>
    **Result**: Transformed ResetHomeVolumeHandler into ManageVolumesHandler supporting selective reset of home/workspace/cache volumes via checkboxes in UI, fixed template inheritance to properly extend JupyterHub's default home.html (resolving 404 errors), updated to Bootstrap 5 modal API (data-bs-toggle, data-bs-target, btn-close), wrapped JavaScript in RequireJS callback for proper module loading, added Font Awesome icons (fa-rotate for restart, fa-database for volumes), implemented automatic page refresh after Stop Server/Manage Volumes/Restart Server actions, updated API endpoint to `/api/users/{username}/manage-volumes` accepting JSON body with volume array, backend now processes multiple volumes and returns detailed success/failure response, bumped version to 3.0.12 reflecting major feature enhancement

7. **Task - Document self-service features in README**: Updated README with features section and screenshots demonstrating new self-service capabilities<br>
    **Result**: Added comprehensive Features section with bullet points covering GPU auto-detection, user self-service, isolated environments, native authentication, shared storage, and production-ready setup, created Self-Service Volume Management subsection with three screenshots (restart server button, manage volumes button, volume selection modal) and one-sentence descriptions for each, positioned visual documentation prominently after feature list to demonstrate user-facing functionality

8. **Task - Production readiness and CI/CD setup**: Implemented visual enhancements, GitHub Actions workflow, architecture documentation, and resolved critical production issues<br>
    **Result**: Added Font Awesome icons to all control buttons (fa-stop, fa-play, fa-rotate, fa-database), implemented MutationObserver for auto page refresh after server stop with icon re-injection before refresh, created GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for Dockerfile validation with hadolint, pinned JupyterHub base image to version 5.4.2 (resolved DL3007 warning), reorganized README with mermaid architecture diagram showing Traefik -> Hub -> Spawner -> User containers flow with transparent background for dark mode compatibility, removed Claude co-authoring from entire git history (95 commits rewritten), fixed critical ModuleNotFoundError by adding /srv/jupyterhub to sys.path in config, built jupyterhub_config.py into Docker image by default (changed build context to project root, image now self-contained and works out-of-box), added pull_policy: build to prevent Docker Compose from pulling image after local build, created release tags STABLE_3.0.23 and RELEASE_3.0.23, version progression 3.0.20 -> 3.0.23 reflecting stability and production readiness improvements

9. **Task - Privileged user docker.sock access**: Implemented group-based access control for Docker socket mounting in user containers<br>
    **Result**: Created built-in protected group system with `docker-privileged` as single source of truth in config/jupyterhub_config.py::BUILTIN_GROUPS, implemented pre_spawn_hook to check group membership and conditionally mount /var/run/docker.sock with rw permissions, created startup script 02_ensure_groups.py that reads BUILTIN_GROUPS from config and creates missing groups before JupyterHub starts (follows DRY principle), added runtime protection in pre_spawn_hook to recreate groups if deleted, group cannot be permanently removed - auto-recreates on startup and before every container spawn, updated documentation in README and CLAUDE.md with security warnings about root-level host access, added instructions for admins to manage group membership through JupyterHub admin panel at /hub/admin, created four slash commands for common workflows: /build (verbose image build), /start (background compose up with log monitoring), /stop (make clean with orphan removal), /publish (journal update, rich commit, git push), bumped version to 3.1.2 reflecting new privileged access control feature

10. **Task - Notification broadcast system**: Implemented admin-only notification broadcast to all active JupyterLab servers with jupyterlab_notifications_extension integration<br>
    **Result**: Created BroadcastNotificationHandler and NotificationsPageHandler in custom_handlers.py for admin-only access at /hub/notifications, implemented concurrent notification delivery using asyncio.gather() with 5-second timeout per server, added temporary API token generation (5-minute expiry) for server authentication, created notifications.html template with message input (140 char limit), type selector (default/info/success/warning/error/in-progress), auto-close toggle, and live character counter, dynamically constructs endpoint URLs using spawner.server.base_url for correct routing, sends notifications to /jupyterlab-notifications-extension/ingest with proper payload format (type field not variant, actions array with Dismiss button), implemented comprehensive error handling for connection timeouts, auth failures, missing extensions with user-friendly messages, added one-line logging per server showing username, message preview, notification type, and outcome (SUCCESS/FAILED/ERROR), registered handlers in jupyterhub_config.py extra_handlers, updated CLAUDE.md and README.md with detailed feature documentation, added navigation link on home page for admin access, resolved Docker build cache issues requiring --no-cache flag to properly include new handlers, bumped version to 3.2.0 reflecting major notification broadcast feature

11. **Task - Documentation and screenshots**: Created minimal documentation for notification system, UI customization, and Docker socket permissions following super-minimal modus primaris style<br>
    **Result**: Created doc/notifications.md (35 lines - key technical facts, handler implementation, dependencies, error handling), doc/ui-template-customization.md (55 lines - JavaScript patterns, Bootstrap 5 syntax, CSRF protection, build process), doc/docker-socket-permissions.md (66 lines - pre-spawn hook implementation, built-in group system, security implications), updated README.md User Interface section replacing screenshot-restart-server.png with screenshot-home.png showing complete user control panel and adding screenshot-send-notification.png displaying admin notification broadcast interface, refreshed .claude/CLAUDE.md with accurate notification system technical details (140 char limit, all 6 notification types, temporary token generation with 5-minute expiry, correct endpoint URL pattern with base_url interpolation, hyphenated extension path, Dismiss button feature, HTTP 500 error handling, one-line logging details), all documentation simplified to "glimpse of implementation" with essential bullet points and code snippets absent of lengthy narrative

12. **Task - Configuration-agnostic volume management with optional descriptions**: Refactored volume management to dynamically read from configuration and added optional volume descriptions<br>
    **Result**: Modified jupyterhub_config.py to define DOCKER_SPAWNER_VOLUMES as module-level constant, created get_user_volume_suffixes() function extracting volume suffixes matching jupyterlab-{username}_<suffix> pattern, added USER_VOLUME_SUFFIXES calculated from DOCKER_SPAWNER_VOLUMES (importable by handlers), protected all c.* assignments with 'if c is not None:' guards to allow module import without NameError, added optional VOLUME_DESCRIPTIONS dict mapping volume suffixes to user-friendly descriptions, exposed volume_descriptions via c.JupyterHub.template_vars, updated home.html template to use Jinja2 loop generating checkboxes dynamically from user_volume_suffixes with conditional description display, modified ManageVolumesHandler to validate against USER_VOLUME_SUFFIXES from config instead of hardcoded set, simplified README.md following modus primaris (features first, simplified notification description, simplified architecture diagram labels), updated documentation in .claude/CLAUDE.md (Manage Volumes section with configuration example, simplified Restart Server section) and doc/ui-template-customization.md (added template variables section), UI now fully agnostic working correctly if volumes renamed/added/removed in configuration without template or handler changes

13. **Task - Release v3.2.11 preparation and documentation refinement**: Tagged release, prepared delta notes, simplified documentation, corrected security warnings<br>
    **Result**: Created git tag RELEASE_3.2.11 with annotations covering configuration-agnostic volume management, notification broadcast, privileged access control, created RELEASE.md delta release notes documenting major features (configuration-agnostic volume management with optional descriptions, admin notification broadcast with 6 types, privileged user docker.sock access control), technical improvements (module-level constants, dynamic handlers/templates), documentation updates (modus primaris style, new screenshots), version history (v3.2.11 ← v3.2.0 ← v3.1.2 ← v3.0.23 ← v3.0.14), upgrade notes with backward compatibility, simplified doc/docker-socket-permissions.md from 66 to 19 lines removing verbose explanations/use cases/auditing commands, updated project.env with RELEASE_TAG and RELEASE_DATE metadata, corrected docker.sock security warnings changing "host system" to "Docker host" (docker.sock grants Docker daemon access not physical host), applied HTML alert styling (alert-block alert-warning) to security warnings in README.md for better visibility, updated security warnings in README.md (Requirements and Privileged Access sections), doc/docker-socket-permissions.md, and .claude/CLAUDE.md

14. **Task - Configuration flow and UI workflow diagrams**: created mermaid diagrams illustrating settings interaction and user self-service workflows<br>
    **Result**: added Configuration Flow section to README after Architecture section showing how environment variables in compose.yml (ADMIN, NOTEBOOK_IMAGE, NETWORK, GPU, SSL, MLFLOW, GLANCES, TENSORBOARD) flow through jupyterhub_config.py (AUTH, SPAWN, VOLS, HOOK) to spawned user containers (LAB, MLFLOW, GLANCES, TENSORBOARD, GPUACCESS), three-layer graph with amber/green/blue color scheme indicating configuration source, processing layer, and runtime services, removed fill colors from shapes (stroke-only styling), restructured ENABLE_SERVICE_* as horizontal subgraph showing MLflow/Glances/TensorBoard as examples passed to Lab env, expanded CONFIG section to include DOCKER_SPAWNER_VOLUMES, VOLUME_DESCRIPTIONS, BUILTIN_GROUPS, pre_spawn_hook, extra_handlers (ManageVolumes/RestartServer/Notifications), template_paths, DOCKER_NOTEBOOK_DIR, added JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL, TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL, NVIDIA_AUTODETECT_IMAGE to ENV section, consolidated RUNTIME section showing Services controlled by ENABLE_SERVICE_* env vars, created separate GPU Auto-Detection section with flowchart diagram showing decision logic (ENABLE_GPU_SUPPORT values 0/1/2), auto-detect mechanism spawning temporary nvidia/cuda container running nvidia-smi, success/failure paths setting NVIDIA_DETECTED flag, cleanup of test container jupyterhub_nvidia_autodetect, and final application of device_requests to spawned containers, created User Self-Service Workflow diagram showing home page UI states (server running vs stopped), custom buttons (Restart Server with fa-rotate icon, Manage Volumes with fa-database icon), modal interface with checkboxes and optional descriptions, API handlers (RestartServerHandler, ManageVolumesHandler) with @admin_or_self permissions, Docker operations (container.restart, spawner.stop, volume.remove, spawner.start), AJAX requests (POST for restart, DELETE for volume management with JSON payload), auto page refresh via MutationObserver after successful operations, created Volume Architecture diagram showing multi-user deployment with two example users (user1, user2) each having three dedicated volumes (home, workspace, cache) mounted at /home, /home/lab/workspace, /home/lab/.cache respectively, single jupyterhub_shared volume represented as shared resource mounted at /mnt/shared accessible from all user containers, improved arrow alignment by repositioning MSHARED node between HOST and CONTAINER subgraphs with solid arrow from VOLSHARED emphasizing direct mount relationship and dashed arrows to containers showing accessibility, added note explaining users can selectively reset personal volumes (home/workspace/cache) through Manage Volumes when server stopped but shared volume protected from individual user reset, converted HTML alert divs to GitHub-style WARNING blocks (two instances in README)

15. **Task - Update watchtower image**: Replaced deprecated watchtower image with maintained fork<br>
    **Result**: Changed watchtower image from containrrr/watchtower:latest to nickfedor/watchtower:latest in compose.yml, new image is actively maintained and compatible with latest Docker versions, bumped version to 3.3.1

16. **Task - Cleanup startup scripts**: Removed obsolete nvidia-smi script and renumbered ensure_groups<br>
    **Result**: Deleted 01_nvidia-smi.sh (GPU detection now uses separate nvidia/cuda container spawned by jupyterhub_config.py), renamed 02_ensure_groups.py to 01_ensure_groups.py for sequential ordering, bumped version to 3.3.2

17. **Task - Fix Watchtower refresh frequency**: Investigated and fixed Watchtower scheduling issues<br>
    **Result**: Removed unsupported `--no-startup` flag (caused crash), fixed cron expression from 5-field `0 0 * * *` to 6-field `0 0 0 * * *` (watchtower uses seconds) - was running hourly instead of daily at midnight UTC

18. **Task - Refactor Docker access control groups**: Split into two groups with distinct purposes<br>
    **Result**: Renamed `docker-privileged` to `docker-sock` (mounts docker.sock), created new `docker-privileged` (runs with --privileged flag). Updated pre_spawn_hook to check both groups and set spawner.volumes or spawner.privileged accordingly. Updated README.md, doc/docker-socket-permissions.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md with new group documentation

19. **Task - Fix privileged container mode**: DockerSpawner privileged flag not working<br>
    **Result**: Changed from `spawner.privileged = True` to `spawner.extra_host_config['privileged'] = True` - DockerSpawner requires extra_host_config dict for host configuration options. Bumped version to 3.4.1

20. **Task - Exclude watchtower from self-updates**: Prevent watchtower from updating itself<br>
    **Result**: Added `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false` label to watchtower service in compose.yml - legacy namespace kept by forks for backward compatibility

21. **Task - Traefik host-based routing template**: Created deployment template for local Traefik with self-signed certificates<br>
    **Result**: Added `extra/traefik-host-based-routing/` template for creating `<name>_stellars_jupyterhub_ds` deployments with local Traefik reverse proxy (ports 80/443), self-signed wildcard certificates, and HTTP->HTTPS redirect. Includes compose_override.yml with YOURDOMAIN placeholder, Makefile (start/stop/pull/logs/status), start.sh (clone/pull + start), stop.sh, generate-certs.sh (creates wildcard cert and tls.yml for given domain), .gitignore (excludes certs and cloned repo). Updated extra/README.md with template listing

22. **Task - Fix root path base URL redirect**: Fixed double-slash issue when JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL=/<br>
    **Result**: Added `JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL_PREFIX` normalization in `config/jupyterhub_config.py`. When `JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL` is `/`, `''`, or `None`, prefix becomes empty string. Updated three URL concatenations (default_url, hub_connect_url, base_url) to use prefix instead of raw BASE_URL. Prevents browser interpreting `//hub/home` as protocol-relative URL pointing to host `hub`

23. **Task - Update traefik-host-based-routing template**: Refactored deployment template for root path routing<br>
    **Result**: Removed Makefile from `extra/traefik-host-based-routing/`. Updated `compose_override.yml` with `JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL=/` and root path Traefik routing. Updated `start.sh` to pull images and use `--no-build`. Updated README to reflect simplified workflow without Makefile

24. **Task - User rename with authorization preservation**: Implemented admin API to rename users while preserving NativeAuthenticator authorization<br>
    **Result**: Created `RenameUserHandler` in `custom_handlers.py` with PATCH `/hub/api/users/{username}/rename` endpoint. Handler updates both JupyterHub `User` and NativeAuthenticator `UserInfo` tables atomically, preserving `is_authorized` status. Requires admin privileges and stopped server. Includes validation (name uniqueness, server state), rollback on failure, and detailed logging. Registered handler in `jupyterhub_config.py`. Added Admin Features section to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` documenting the problem (UserInfo not synced on rename), solution (atomic update of both tables), and API contract

25. **Task - Fix NativeAuthenticator sync on rename**: Replaced broken handler approach with SQLAlchemy event listener<br>
    **Result**: Discovered `extra_handlers` appends to default handlers (doesn't override), so `SyncedUserAPIHandler` was never called. Implemented SQLAlchemy `@event.listens_for(orm.User.name, 'set')` in `jupyterhub_config.py` to intercept ALL User.name changes at ORM level. Removed `SyncedUserAPIHandler` and `RenameUserHandler` classes from `custom_handlers.py`. Removed corresponding routes from `extra_handlers`. Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` replacing "Admin Features > Rename User" with simpler "NativeAuthenticator Sync" note. New approach catches renames from admin panel, API, and any other source automatically

26. **Task - Version display in browser console**: Added version badge to browser JavaScript console<br>
    **Result**: Added `ARG VERSION=dev` and `ENV STELLARS_JUPYTERHUB_VERSION=${VERSION}` to Dockerfile. Updated `compose.yml` build args to pass `VERSION=${VERSION:-dev}`. Updated `scripts/build.sh` and `scripts/build_verbose.sh` to source `project.env` and export VERSION. Added `stellars_version` template variable in `jupyterhub_config.py`. Added styled console.log in `home.html` displaying blue "Stellars JupyterHub DS" + green version badge in browser console

27. **Task - Admin user creation with credentials modal**: Implemented auto-generation of passwords when admin creates users via admin panel<br>
    **Result**: Added `after_insert` SQLAlchemy event listener in `jupyterhub_config.py` to auto-create NativeAuthenticator UserInfo with memorable 3-word password (e.g., storm-apple-ocean) and `is_authorized=1` (auto-approved). Added `after_delete` listener to clean up UserInfo when user deleted. Created password cache in `custom_handlers.py` with 5-minute expiry for secure credential handoff. Added `GetUserCredentialsHandler` API at `/api/users/credentials` for admin retrieval. Created `templates_enhanced/` directory with customized templates - enhanced `admin.html` with fetch interceptor to detect user creation, credentials modal with copy/download functionality, enhanced `page.html` with NativeAuth nav items (Change Password, Authorize Users). Fixed Dockerfile to copy from `templates_enhanced/` instead of `templates/`. Fixed fetch interceptor to handle URL objects (React passes URL object, not string). Changed version console.log to plain text format

28. **Task - Fix admin template URL handling**: Fixed fetch interceptor and nav links in templates_enhanced<br>
    **Result**: Fixed `isUserCreation` check in admin.html to strip query params (`?_xsrf=...`) before checking if URL ends with `api/users` - React admin adds XSRF token as query param which broke the endpoint detection. Fixed double "hub" prefix in page.html nav links - changed `{{ base_url }}hub/authorize` to `{{ base_url }}authorize` and `{{ base_url }}hub/change-password` to `{{ base_url }}change-password` since base_url already includes `/hub/`

29. **Task - Fix credentials API route conflict**: Changed credentials endpoint from `/api/users/credentials` to `/api/admin/credentials`<br>
    **Result**: JupyterHub's built-in `/api/users/*` handler was catching requests before custom handler, returning "Invalid JSON keys" error. Changed route in jupyterhub_config.py, admin.html, and custom_handlers.py docstring

30. **Task - Credentials modal UX improvements**: Enhanced modal layout, scrolling, and loading feedback<br>
    **Result**: Moved Copy/Download buttons to top of modal body. Added scrollable container (max-height 300px) for long user lists. Removed `<code>` styling for plain text display. Added loading spinner modal shown between user creation and credentials display. Improved Makefile version output format to show "Current version" and "New version" lines

31. **Task - Fix password storage and enable bake**: Fixed NativeAuthenticator password storage format and Docker build configuration<br>
    **Result**: Changed password storage from decoded string to bytes - bcrypt.hashpw() returns bytes which NativeAuthenticator ORM expects as LargeBinary. Previous string storage caused "argument 'salt': 'str' object cannot be converted to 'PyBytes'" error on login. Enabled COMPOSE_BAKE=true in build.sh, build_verbose.sh, and .claude/commands/build.md to use Docker's bake builder (removes deprecation warning). Tagged STABLE_3.5.10

32. **Task - Per-row copy icon in credentials modal**: Added individual copy functionality for each credential row<br>
    **Result**: Added third column with subtle copy icon (40% opacity) for each row in credentials table. Click handler copies "Username: xxx\nPassword: yyy" to clipboard. Icon changes to checkmark briefly (1.5s) after successful copy, then returns to copy icon

33. **Task - Comment out console logs**: Removed debug console output from admin template<br>
    **Result**: Commented out all console.log and console.error statements in admin.html (11 total) - fetch interceptor logs, user creation detection, credentials fetch/receive, error handlers. Version display in home.html remains active as only console output

34. **Task - Comprehensive UI styling enhancements**: Extended custom.css with consistent styling across all JupyterHub pages<br>
    **Result**: Added notifications page styling (form container, textarea, character counter, results section with banded table, status badges), removed obtrusive hover highlight on admin user rows (replaced with subtle 0.003 alpha effect), set collapsed user card padding to 0 to override inline styles, unified button font sizes to 0.8rem across all pages (authorization buttons, token revoke, admin actions, collapse buttons, toggle details), added Add Users form panel styling (labels, textarea, submit button, dark mode support), disabled hover on expanded card tables via box-shadow override, added groups page styling (list items, card footer, badges), styled collapse/expand buttons (0.2rem 0.3rem padding), added username label spacing, dark mode Add Users button with explicit colors (#f8f9fa bg, #6c757d border)

35. **Task - Traefik template start.sh --refresh flag**: Added optional refresh flag to start.sh for pulling latest upstream<br>
    **Result**: Modified extra/traefik-host-based-routing/start.sh to clone repo only once on first run, skip git operations if repo exists (just uses existing), added --refresh flag to pull latest from origin/main when explicitly requested

36. **Task - Volume renamer script**: Created extra/volume-renamer with script for renaming Docker volumes between users<br>
    **Result**: Created rename-user-volumes.sh - renames all jupyterlab-* volumes from source pattern to target username, handles Docker's dot-to-hex encoding (. becomes -2e), supports --dry-run (show mappings without changes) and --keep-orig (preserve source volumes), compact help with generic examples (oldnick -> first.last)

37. **Task - UI refinements and icon cleanup**: Admin panel styling and password toggle icon improvements<br>
    **Result**: Aligned admin action buttons to right (td.actions text-align), added transparent background for dark mode .server-dashboard-container, made table hover nearly invisible (--bs-table-hover-bg: rgba 0.003), replaced eye emoji with Font Awesome icons (fa-eye/fa-eye-slash) in all 4 password templates (signup, login, change-password, change-password-admin) - both button HTML and JavaScript toggle

38. **Task - Table hover and README update**: Fixed Bootstrap table-hover styling and documented mnemonic passwords feature<br>
    **Result**: Added --bs-table-accent-bg override for Bootstrap 5 table-hover (two-step variable process), reduced Shutdown Hub button margin from 30px to 5px, removed color override from dark mode .server-dashboard-container, updated README Features with admin user creation and mnemonic passwords (e.g., storm-apple-ocean)

39. **Task - Authorization page improvements**: Protected users with accounts from accidental discard<br>
    **Result**: Added JavaScript to authorization-area.html that fetches /api/users and hides Discard buttons for usernames that exist in JupyterHub (initial custom handler approach failed - NativeAuthenticator handlers take precedence over extra_handlers), removed unused AuthorizationAreaHandler from config and custom_handlers.py, made authorization table compact with CSS for .authorization-container, fixed 403 error by adding X-XSRFToken header and credentials to fetch request

40. **Task - Fix table hover color override**: Admin panel table hover color not being overridden despite CSS<br>
    **Result**: Discovered Bootstrap 5 table-hover targets td/th cells specifically while our CSS used universal `> *` selector. Fixed by changing selectors to explicitly target `> td, > th` and using `transparent` instead of CSS variables. Updated three rule sets: table-hover override (lines 1055-1061), user-row hover (lines 1086-1092), and dark mode user-row hover (lines 1364-1370)

41. **Task - Server-side authorization discard fix**: Replaced clunky JavaScript API call with server-side Jinja2 logic<br>
    **Result**: Created StellarsNativeAuthenticator subclass that overrides get_handlers() to inject CustomAuthorizationAreaHandler, which passes hub_usernames set to template. Updated authorization-area.html to use `{% if user.username not in hub_usernames %}` instead of JavaScript fetch. Removes API call, XSRF token handling, and flash of Discard buttons before hiding

42. **Task - Custom logo support**: Added JUPYTERHUB_LOGO_FILE configuration for custom branding<br>
    **Result**: Added logo_file config that checks for file at /srv/jupyterhub/logo.svg (or JUPYTERHUB_LOGO_FILE env var), JupyterHub serves it at {{ base_url }}logo automatically. Fixed CustomAuthorizationAreaHandler 403 by adding @needs_scope('admin:users') decorator and importing orm inside get() method. Simplified page.html logo block to always use base_url/logo

43. **Task - Enhance certs-installer scripts**: Added optional folder parameter and help option<br>
    **Result**: Updated install_cert.sh and install_cert.bat to accept optional directory argument (default: current directory), added -h/--help/? flags showing usage, supported file types, and examples. Both scripts now display which directory is being scanned

44. **Task - Fix volume reset encoding**: Fixed Docker volume/container name encoding for special characters<br>
    **Result**: Added encode_username_for_docker() function using escapism library (same as DockerSpawner) to ensure compatibility with JupyterHub's naming scheme. Updated ManageVolumesHandler (line 152), RestartServerHandler (line 227), and BroadcastNotificationHandler (line 454) to use encoded usernames. Handles special characters like `.` -> `-2e`, `@` -> `-40` matching JupyterHub's default encoding

45. **Task - Selective notification recipients**: Enhanced notification broadcast to allow targeting specific servers<br>
    **Result**: Added ActiveServersHandler (`GET /api/notifications/active-servers`) to list active servers. Modified BroadcastNotificationHandler to accept optional `recipients` array - filters to selected users if provided, sends to all if omitted (backward compatible). Updated notifications.html with "Send to all active servers" checkbox, server selection list with Select All/Deselect All buttons, dynamic button text showing recipient count. Validation prevents sending with no recipients selected

46. **Task - Idle server culler**: Implemented automatic shutdown of inactive servers<br>
    **Result**: Added jupyterhub-idle-culler package to Dockerfile. Added configuration with environment variables: IDLE_CULLER_ENABLED (default 0), IDLE_CULLER_TIMEOUT (default 86400s/24h), IDLE_CULLER_CULL_EVERY (default 600s/10min), IDLE_CULLER_MAX_AGE (default 0/unlimited). Service runs as managed JupyterHub service with role-based scopes. Disabled by default, opt-in via IDLE_CULLER_ENABLED=1. Bumped version to 3.6.0

47. **Task - Standardize env vars with JUPYTERHUB_ prefix**: Renamed all environment variables to use consistent JUPYTERHUB_ prefix and added admin Settings page<br>
    **Result**: Renamed 13 environment variables (ENABLE_GPU_SUPPORT->JUPYTERHUB_GPU_ENABLED, ENABLE_JUPYTERHUB_SSL->JUPYTERHUB_SSL_ENABLED, ENABLE_SERVICE_*->JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_*, ENABLE_SIGNUP->JUPYTERHUB_SIGNUP_ENABLED, DOCKER_NOTEBOOK_IMAGE->JUPYTERHUB_NOTEBOOK_IMAGE, DOCKER_NETWORK_NAME->JUPYTERHUB_NETWORK_NAME, NVIDIA_AUTODETECT_IMAGE->JUPYTERHUB_NVIDIA_IMAGE, IDLE_CULLER_*->JUPYTERHUB_IDLE_CULLER_*). Created SettingsPageHandler with admin-only access at /settings showing read-only banded table of all configuration values. Updated compose.yml, jupyterhub_config.py, custom_handlers.py, README.md, CLAUDE.md. Added Settings link to admin navbar. No backward compatibility for old names. Bumped version to 3.6.1

48. **Task - Settings dictionary YAML**: Externalized settings metadata to config/settings_dictionary.yml<br>
    **Result**: Created settings_dictionary.yml with categories as top-level keys (JupyterHub Core, Docker Spawner, GPU, Services, Idle Culler, Branding), each containing list of settings with name, description, default, and optional empty_display. Updated SettingsPageHandler to load from YAML instead of hardcoded values. Added pyyaml to Dockerfile pip install. Dockerfile now copies settings_dictionary.yml to /srv/jupyterhub/

49. **Task - xkcdpass password generation**: Replaced custom word list with xkcdpass library for auto-generated passwords<br>
    **Result**: Moved settings_dictionary.yml to services/jupyterhub/conf/ for proper image baking. Replaced hardcoded word list with xkcdpass library for memorable password generation. Added configurable env vars: JUPYTERHUB_AUTOGENERATED_PASSWORD_WORDS (default 4) and JUPYTERHUB_AUTOGENERATED_PASSWORD_DELIMITER (default "-"). Added xkcdpass to Dockerfile pip install. Fixed ENABLE_SIGNUP to JUPYTERHUB_SIGNUP_ENABLED in Dockerfile defaults

50. **Task - Cleanup templates directory structure**: Removed redundant HTML files and renamed directory for clarity<br>
    **Result**: Removed unused *.html files from services/jupyterhub/templates/ (only certs/ subdirectory needed). Renamed templates_enhanced to html_templates_enhanced for clearer naming. Updated Dockerfile COPY paths accordingly

51. **Task - Version footer on home page**: Added version status bar to home page matching admin page style<br>
    **Result**: Added `{% block footer %}` to home.html displaying "Stellars JupyterHub DS X.Y.Z | JupyterHub X.Y.Z". Uses `stellars_version.split('_')[0]` to show only major.minor.patch (strips _jh-x.x suffix). Added `<div class="mt-5 pt-5"></div>` spacer before footer for visual separation from content. Uses `server_version` template variable for JupyterHub version

52. **Task - Fix server_version not populated**: Investigated and fixed missing JupyterHub version in home page footer<br>
    **Result**: Discovered `AdminHandler` explicitly passes `server_version` to admin.html but `HomeHandler` does not pass it to home.html - it's handler-specific, not global. Added `jupyterhub.__version__` to `c.JupyterHub.template_vars` in jupyterhub_config.py making `server_version` available globally to all templates

53. **Task - Create stop.sh script**: Added stop.sh to complement start.sh for platform shutdown<br>
    **Result**: Created stop.sh mirroring start.sh pattern - resolves script location via readlink/dirname, respects compose_override.yml if present, runs docker compose down --remove-orphans

54. **Task - Enhance traefik-host-based-routing template**: Major improvements to deployment template with CIFS support and certificate installers<br>
    **Result**: Added optional CIFS mount support via compose_cifs.yml and .env.example (ENABLE_CIFS=1), created install_cert.sh for Linux (multi-distro: Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS, Arch, Alpine, macOS) and enhanced install_cert.bat for Windows with folder argument and help flags, fixed compose_override.yml stray quote and added JUPYTERHUB_IDLE_CULLER_ENABLED/JUPYTERHUB_SIGNUP_ENABLED defaults, enhanced generate-certs.sh with generic CN for browser compatibility and verification output, updated start.sh/stop.sh to load .env and conditionally include compose_cifs.yml, updated README with CIFS instructions and certificate installation commands, added .env to .gitignore

55. **Task - Rename GLANCES to RESOURCES_MONITOR**: Renamed environment variable for clarity<br>
    **Result**: Renamed JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_GLANCES to JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_RESOURCES_MONITOR across compose.yml, jupyterhub_config.py, settings_dictionary.yml, README.md, and CLAUDE.md

56. **Task - Idle culler session extension feature**: Implemented user session extension capability for idle culler<br>
    **Result**: Added JUPYTERHUB_IDLE_CULLER_MAX_EXTENSION env var (default 24 hours) to jupyterhub_config.py, created SessionInfoHandler (GET /api/users/{username}/session-info) and ExtendSessionHandler (POST /api/users/{username}/extend-session) in custom_handlers.py, added Session Status card to home.html with countdown timer, extension dropdown (1h/2h/4h/8h), and extension allowance display, extension tracking stored in spawner.orm_spawner.state (resets on server restart), timer updates locally every 60s with server refresh every 5 minutes, color-coded warnings (yellow < 1h, red < 30min), extension button disabled when limit reached, added all idle culler settings to compose.yml (ENABLED, TIMEOUT, INTERVAL, MAX_AGE, MAX_EXTENSION), added setting to settings_dictionary.yml, updated README.md Idle Server Culler section with MAX_EXTENSION documentation, passed idle_culler_enabled/timeout/max_extension to templates via template_vars

57. **Task - Harmonize env settings across files**: Ensured all env settings are consistent in compose.yml, Dockerfile, and config<br>
    **Result**: Added all missing ENV defaults to Dockerfile (ADMIN, BASE_URL, SSL_ENABLED, NOTEBOOK_IMAGE, NETWORK_NAME, GPU_ENABLED, NVIDIA_IMAGE, SERVICE_MLFLOW/RESOURCES_MONITOR/TENSORBOARD, all IDLE_CULLER settings, TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL), added AUTOGENERATED_PASSWORD_WORDS/DELIMITER to compose.yml, standardized logo setting as JUPYTERHUB_LOGO_URI with file:// prefix (supports external http/https URIs), updated NVIDIA_IMAGE to nvidia/cuda:13.0.2-base-ubuntu24.04 across all files (compose.yml, jupyterhub_config.py, Dockerfile, settings_dictionary.yml, README.md, CLAUDE.md), config now strips file:// prefix for local files while allowing external URI support in templates

58. **Task - Improve session extension UI**: Changed extension input from dropdown to numeric and added explanatory note<br>
    **Result**: Replaced dropdown with numeric input (min=1, max set dynamically to available hours), renamed card title to "Idle Session Timeout", added explanatory note "Your server will be stopped after a period of inactivity to free up resources", added input validation for minimum 1 hour, button text shortened to "Extend"

59. **Task - Session extension truncation and cumulative logic**: Fixed extension behavior to be cumulative and truncate excess requests<br>
    **Result**: Changed extension logic from resetting timer to cumulative additions (extensions ADD to remaining time), fixed datetime timezone mismatch (use offset-naive datetime.utcnow() to match JupyterHub internal format), implemented truncation when requested hours exceed available (truncates to max available instead of rejecting), added `truncated` flag in API response with detailed message, UI shows warning alert (yellow) when truncated with 4-second display vs 2-second for normal success, fixed extend button re-enable after successful extension, added detailed logging showing base timeout, extension calculations, and remaining time, kept extend button enabled when max reached (backend handles rejection with error message)

60. **Task - Fix activity tracking to use spawner not user**: Changed session timer to use spawner.orm_spawner.last_activity instead of user.last_activity<br>
    **Result**: Discovered user.last_activity updates on any Hub page access (causing timer reset on refresh), while spawner.orm_spawner.last_activity only updates on actual JupyterLab activity - which matches what jupyterhub-idle-culler uses for culling decisions. Updated SessionInfoHandler and ExtendSessionHandler to use spawner.orm_spawner.last_activity (Server object has no last_activity attribute), added /checkpoint command for creating milestone tags before major changes

61. **Task - Activity Monitor page implementation**: Created admin-only activity monitoring page with database persistence, 3-state status indicator, proper activity scoring, and reset functionality<br>
    **Result**: Implemented comprehensive user activity monitoring system for JupyterHub administrators with multiple iterations to refine the design. **Database Layer**: ActivitySample SQLAlchemy model stored in JupyterHub's existing SQLite database with columns (id, username, timestamp, last_activity, active) and composite index on username+timestamp for efficient queries. **ActivityMonitor Singleton**: Central service class with methods - record_sample() stores activity snapshots marking user active if last_activity within INACTIVE_AFTER threshold, get_score() calculates weighted activity using exponential decay formula `weight = exp(-lambda * age_hours)` where `lambda = ln(2) / half_life` with score computed as ratio of weighted_active to weighted_total from measured samples only (unmeasured periods don't count against user), get_status() returns aggregate statistics, rename_user()/delete_user() handle lifecycle events, prune_old_samples() removes expired data, reset_all() clears all samples for admin reset functionality. **Environment Variables**: JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_SAMPLE_INTERVAL (default 600s/10min - sampling frequency), JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_RETENTION_DAYS (default 7 days), JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_HALF_LIFE (default 24h - decay rate), JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_INACTIVE_AFTER (default 60min - threshold for marking user inactive). Added to Dockerfile ENV defaults and settings_dictionary.yml for Settings page display. **Backend Handlers**: ActivityPageHandler renders activity.html template, ActivityDataHandler returns JSON with per-user data (username, server_active, recently_active, cpu_percent, memory_mb, memory_percent, time_remaining_seconds, activity_score, sample_count, last_activity) plus timestamp, sampling_status, and inactive_after_seconds, ActivityResetHandler (POST /api/activity/reset) clears all activity data with admin-only access. **3-State Status Indicator**: Green (#28a745 explicit hex - not Bootstrap text-success which appeared teal) for server running AND recently_active (activity within INACTIVE_AFTER minutes), Yellow (text-warning) for server running BUT inactive (exceeded INACTIVE_AFTER threshold), Red (text-danger) for server offline. Tooltips updated to "Online (active)", "Online (inactive)", "Offline". **Activity Bar**: Score 0-100 mapped to 0-5 lit segments, colors based on level (green ≥4 segments, yellow ≥2, red <2), unlit segments rendered as transparent with gray border outline. **Frontend Features**: JavaScript handles 30-second auto-refresh via setInterval, manual Refresh button, Reset button (red with trash icon) with confirmation dialog that calls /api/activity/reset and refreshes data, loading spinner, empty state message, XSRF token handling. Column header shows "Activity (7 days)" matching retention period. **Score Calculation Fix**: Original implementation checked if last_activity changed between samples - flawed because JupyterLab reports activity infrequently so most samples showed "no change" = inactive. Fixed to check if last_activity is within INACTIVE_AFTER minutes of sample time. Score calculation changed from normalizing against theoretical maximum to using ratio of weighted active samples to weighted total measured samples - ensures unmeasured periods don't penalize users. **User Lifecycle Integration**: SQLAlchemy event listener in jupyterhub_config.py calls rename_activity_user() on User.name changes and delete_activity_user() on user deletion. **Performance Optimization**: Original implementation caused "Event loop was unresponsive for at least 5.x seconds" warnings because Docker stats API calls (container.stats(stream=False)) block for ~2 seconds per container. Fixed by adding ThreadPoolExecutor (_docker_executor with 4 workers, thread_name_prefix="docker-stats") and async wrapper get_container_stats_async() using loop.run_in_executor(). ActivityDataHandler collects active users first, fetches all Docker stats in parallel via asyncio.gather(*stats_tasks, return_exceptions=True), reducing response time from O(n*2s) to O(2s) regardless of user count while keeping Tornado event loop responsive. **UI Cleanup**: Removed status legend (redundant with tooltips), removed old background sampler thread code (_run_activity_sampler, _sample_all_users, start_activity_sampler, stop_activity_sampler functions) since sampling now happens on-demand when activity page is viewed. **UI Polish**: Refresh button shows spinner while loading data (disables button, replaces icon with spinner-border, re-enables on complete), timestamp display changed from absolute time "Measured: 10:30:00 AM" to relative format "Measured 5min ago" using formatTimeAgo() function (supports just now/Xmin ago/Xh ago/Xd ago)

62. **Task - Activity Monitor UI polish and sample cleanup fix**: Improved activity bar design and fixed sample retention enforcement<br>
    **Result**: Fixed inconsistent timestamp text (initial "Last updated: --" vs loaded "Measured X ago" - removed initial text so only "Measured X ago" shows). Redesigned activity bar from separate 16x16 boxes to thin continuous bar (80px wide, 8px tall) with subtle 1px dividers between 5 segments - visually distinct from day-based layouts. Fixed critical sample cleanup bug - cleanup only ran when new sample was INSERT-ed, not when existing sample was UPDATE-d, causing old samples to persist indefinitely when refreshes kept updating the last sample. Moved cleanup to run on every record_sample() call regardless of update vs insert, ensuring samples older than RETENTION_DAYS are always pruned

63. **Task - Fix SQLite database locking**: Resolved database lock errors preventing login<br>
    **Result**: ActivityMonitor was using JupyterHub's main SQLite database (`/data/jupyterhub.sqlite`) via separate SQLAlchemy connection, causing `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` when both tried to write simultaneously (login + activity sampling). Fixed by moving ActivityMonitor to separate database file `/data/activity_samples.sqlite`, completely avoiding lock contention. Added "Last Active" column to activity table showing relative time since user's last activity (e.g., "5min", "2h"), left-aligned. "Measured X ago" text now updates dynamically every second (shows "5s ago", "3min ago", etc.) using setInterval timer with stored timestamp

64. **Task - Activity monitor sampling refactor**: Removed on-demand sampling and fixed timer display<br>
    **Result**: Removed `JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_SAMPLE_INTERVAL` env var entirely - sampling will be controlled dynamically by caller. Removed on-demand sample recording from ActivityDataHandler (viewing activity page no longer triggers samples). Simplified `record_sample()` to always insert new sample without interval checking. Fixed formatTimeAgo to show nothing when time ≤0s (handles server/client clock skew). Removed interval config from Dockerfile and settings_dictionary.yml. Hide "Measured " prefix when time value is empty. Removed compose.yml/compose_override.yml mention from Settings page footer

65. **Task - Activity table sorting and display improvements**: Added column sorting and improved Last Active display<br>
    **Result**: Added clickable column sorting for User, CPU, Memory, Time Left, Last Active columns. Sorting cycles through descending → ascending → none (default). Sort icons (▲/▼) show current direction. Default sort is activity score descending. Null values sorted to end. Changed Last Active display to match admin page format with full words ("8 minutes ago", "14 days ago", "4 months ago") with proper singular/plural handling

66. **Task - Activity Monitor resource refresh separation**: Separated resource updates from activity sampling with 10-second refresh interval<br>
    **Result**: **Major architectural change** - The Activity Monitor now has a clear separation between two distinct operations: (1) **Resource Updates** - Status (active/inactive/offline), CPU usage, memory usage, and idle culler timers are refreshed automatically every 10 seconds via frontend auto-refresh. This provides real-time monitoring without recording activity history. (2) **Activity Sampling** - Recording of user activity state for historical scoring is completely separate and will be controlled by a background process (not implemented yet). **UI Changes**: Removed "Measured X ago" timer display as it added no value and was confusing when data refreshed automatically. Removed lastMeasuredTimestamp tracking, measureTimeUpdateInterval timer, and formatTimeAgo function. Changed auto-refresh interval from 30 seconds to 10 seconds. **New Environment Variable**: Added `JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_RESOURCES_UPDATE_INTERVAL` (default 10 seconds) to Dockerfile and settings_dictionary.yml for configuring resource refresh rate. **Key Clarification**: Viewing the Activity page or auto-refresh does NOT record activity samples - it only reads current state. Activity samples must be recorded by a separate mechanism (to be implemented) that runs independently of page views

67. **Task - Activity Monitor show all users and sorting**: Extended Activity Monitor to display all users and added status column sorting<br>
    **Result**: **Show All Users**: Previously Activity Monitor only showed users with active servers (3 users). Now shows all users who have: (1) active server, (2) activity samples in database, OR (3) any last_activity timestamp in JupyterHub database. This includes offline users with historical activity (e.g., users who logged in months ago). Badge updated from "3 active servers" to "7 users (3 active)" format. **Backend Changes**: ActivityDataHandler now retrieves last_activity for ALL users (not just active servers), moved last_activity retrieval outside `if server_active` block, changed inclusion condition from `server_active or sample_count > 0` to `server_active or sample_count > 0 or user_data["last_activity"]`. **Status Column Sorting**: Made Status column clickable for sorting (added `sortable` class and `data-sort="status"`). Status sorting priority: green (active=2) > amber (inactive=1) > red (offline=0). **Default Sort**: Changed default from activity_score descending to status descending (green users first, then amber, then red). **Secondary Sort**: All column sorts now include secondary alphabetical sort by username within equal values (users with same status are sorted by name). **Bug Fix**: Status sorting initially didn't work because `getSortValue()` checked `column === 'status'` AFTER the null check - but `user.status` doesn't exist (only `user.server_active` and `user.recently_active`), so it returned early. Fixed by moving status check to beginning of function before null check

68. **Task - Table styling refactor to CSS classes**: Moved inline styles to stylesheet using CSS classes with em units<br>
    **Result**: **Activity Table**: Removed inline styles from activity.html, added `.activity-table` class with `table-layout: fixed` and `width: 100%`. Column classes with final widths: `.col-user` (auto - takes remaining space), `.col-status` (5em), `.col-cpu` (7.5em), `.col-memory` (9em), `.col-timeleft` (12em), `.col-lastactive` (13.5em), `.col-activity` (20em). Added `overflow: hidden` and `text-overflow: ellipsis` for long values. **Settings Table**: Added `.settings-table` class with `.col-category` (12em), `.col-setting` (20em), `.col-value` (auto), `.col-description` (auto, wraps). **Notifications Table**: Added `.notifications-table` class with `.col-username` (12em), `.col-status` (7em), `.col-details` (auto). **UI Polish**: Simplified Activity page subtitle to "Real-time resource usage and engagement metrics", changed badge from `bg-secondary` to `bg-dark` for darker background. All widths use em units for font-relative scaling

69. **Task - Remove CPU/Memory color coding**: Removed threshold-based coloring from resource usage values<br>
    **Result**: Removed color coding from `formatCpu()` and `formatMemory()` functions in activity.html. Previously values changed color based on thresholds (green < 50%, yellow 50-80%, red > 80%) which doesn't make sense for multi-core systems where CPU usage can exceed 100% (e.g., 6400% on 64-core machine). Now displays plain text without color classes

70. **Task - Add Volumes column to Activity Monitor**: Display total volume size per user<br>
    **Result**: **Backend**: Added `get_all_user_volumes_sizes()` function that fetches all Docker volumes matching pattern `jupyterlab-{username}_{suffix}` in one API call, extracts size from `UsageData.Size` attribute (API 1.42+), sums per user, returns dict of `{encoded_username: size_mb}`. Added async wrapper `get_all_user_volumes_sizes_async()` for non-blocking execution. ActivityDataHandler now includes `volume_size_mb` field for each user. **Frontend**: Added sortable Volumes column between Memory and Time Left. Updated badge to show detailed breakdown: "7 users (3 active, 1 idle, 3 offline)" instead of just "(3 active)". Added `formatVolumeSize()` function displaying human-friendly sizes (e.g., "1.5 GB", "500 MB"). **CSS**: Added `.col-volumes` class with 8em width

71. **Task - Volume sizes background caching**: Move volume size fetching to background to avoid blocking page load<br>
    **Result**: **Problem**: `docker system df` (used for volume sizes) is slow and was blocking Activity page load. **Solution**: Implemented background caching with configurable refresh interval. **Cache Structure**: `_volume_sizes_cache` dict with `data` (sizes), `timestamp` (last refresh), `refreshing` (lock flag). **Functions**: `_fetch_volume_sizes()` blocking fetch, `_refresh_volume_sizes_sync()` updates cache, `_refresh_volume_sizes_background()` non-blocking via thread pool, `get_cached_volume_sizes()` returns cache immediately, `get_volume_sizes_with_refresh()` returns cache and triggers background refresh if stale. **New Env Var**: `JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_VOLUMES_UPDATE_INTERVAL` (default 3600 = 1 hour). Activity page now loads instantly - volume sizes served from cache, refreshed hourly in background. First load shows empty volumes until first background refresh completes

72. **Task - Activity sampling for all users including offline**: Record activity samples for ALL users to show progress bars for everyone<br>
    **Result**: **Problem**: Activity sampling only tracked active servers, so offline users had no activity history and no progress bars. **Solution**: Added `record_samples_for_all_users(db, find_user_func)` function that iterates ALL users in JupyterHub database and records samples. Active users with recent activity → marked active. Active users idle → marked inactive. Offline users → marked inactive (uses last_activity from their last session). **New API Endpoint**: `POST /hub/api/activity/sample` (admin only) - triggers sampling for all users, returns `{"success": true, "total": 7, "active": 3, "inactive": 1, "offline": 3}`. Can be called by cron job or scheduler. **Handler**: Added `ActivitySampleHandler` to custom_handlers.py and registered in jupyterhub_config.py. Calls `log_activity_tick()` to log statistics after sampling

73. **Task - Background Activity Sampler implementation**: Automatic periodic activity sampling using Tornado PeriodicCallback<br>
    **Result**: **Problem**: Activity progress bars were empty because no background process was sampling activity - only on-demand API calls. **Solution**: Created `ActivitySampler` singleton class using Tornado's `PeriodicCallback` for non-blocking periodic execution. Uses JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_SAMPLE_INTERVAL (default 600s/10min). Initially attempted `c.JupyterHub.post_init_hook` but this config option doesn't exist. Changed to lazy initialization - sampler starts when admin first accesses Activity page. Sampler accepts `db` and `find_user` directly from handler (not app object). Runs first sample immediately on startup, then at configured interval. Logs tick statistics with `flush=True` for immediate output. **Files Modified**: custom_handlers.py (ActivitySampler class with db/find_user params, lazy start in ActivityDataHandler), jupyterhub_config.py (removed broken post_init_hook)

74. **Task - Activity bar color thresholds**: Changed color scheme to 1=red, 2-3=yellow, 4-5=green<br>
    **Result**: Updated `formatActivityBar()` in activity.html. Previous logic had 0-1 segments as red. New logic: 1 segment red (low activity), 2-3 segments yellow (medium), 4-5 segments green (high). Score 0 shows empty bar with no lit segments

75. **Task - Makefile BUILD_OPTS for skipping version increment**: Added build options configuration matching stellars-jupyterlab-ds pattern<br>
    **Result**: Added `BUILD_OPTS` variable, `NO_VERSION_INCREMENT` check using findstring, `DOCKER_BUILD_OPTS` filtering out --no-version-increment, `maybe_increment_version` conditional target. Updated `build` and `build_verbose` targets to use `maybe_increment_version` and pass `DOCKER_BUILD_OPTS` to scripts. Usage: `make build BUILD_OPTS='--no-version-increment'` or combine with `--no-cache`

76. **Task - Refactor print to logging module**: Replaced print statements with proper Python logging<br>
    **Result**: Added `import logging` and module-level `log = logging.getLogger('jupyterhub.custom_handlers')` to custom_handlers.py. Replaced all `print()` calls with `log.info()` or `log.error()` for ActivityMonitor, ActivitySampler, and Volume Sizes functions. Removed `flush=True` parameters (not needed with logging). Logs now appear properly in JupyterHub's log output

77. **Task - VolumeSizeRefresher for independent background refresh**: Added periodic background refresh for volume sizes<br>
    **Result**: Created `VolumeSizeRefresher` class using Tornado's PeriodicCallback, similar to ActivitySampler. Refreshes volume sizes every hour (JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_VOLUMES_UPDATE_INTERVAL). Lazy starts on first Activity page access. Runs first refresh immediately, then at configured interval. Volume sizes now refresh independently of page views once started

78. **Task - Activity sampler as independent JupyterHub service**: Converted from lazy-start to boot-time service<br>
    **Result**: **Problem**: Activity sampler only started when someone viewed Activity page - not truly independent. **Solution**: Created standalone `activity_sampler.py` service that runs as JupyterHub managed service (like idle-culler). Uses JupyterHub REST API with aiohttp to fetch user activity data. Configured with `activity-sampler-role` having `list:users`, `read:users:activity`, `read:servers` scopes. Service starts automatically on JupyterHub boot, runs continuously with 5-second initial delay. Records samples to same SQLite database (`/data/activity_samples.sqlite`). Removed lazy-start code from ActivityDataHandler. Added aiohttp to Dockerfile dependencies. Renamed env var to `JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_SAMPLE_INTERVAL` for consistency

79. **Task - Activity tracking methodology research**: Documented industry approaches for activity scoring<br>
    **Result**: Created `docs/activity-tracking-methodology.md` covering: (1) Exponential Moving Average with decay - our current approach using half-life parameterization, (2) Time-Window Percentage (Hubstaff) - active seconds per 10-min window with 60-80% typical for development, (3) Daily Target (8h=100%) - maps to work expectations, (4) GitHub Contribution Graph - threshold-based intensity levels. Research confirms our EMA approach is industry-standard. Key insight from Hubstaff: 100% activity is unrealistic, typical ranges 30-80% depending on role

80. **Task - Activity monitor half-life to 48h**: Changed decay half-life default from 24h to 48h<br>
    **Result**: Updated JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_HALF_LIFE default across Dockerfile, custom_handlers.py (DEFAULT_HALF_LIFE constant), activity_sampler.py (code and docstring), settings_dictionary.yml, and README.md. With 48h half-life, a sample from 48 hours ago has 50% weight, providing smoother decay for activity scoring

81. **Task - Volume size tooltip with breakdown**: Added hover tooltip showing per-volume sizes<br>
    **Result**: Modified `_fetch_volume_sizes()` to return `{encoded_username: {"total": float, "volumes": {suffix: float}}}` structure with per-volume breakdown (home, workspace, cache). Updated `ActivityDataHandler` to pass `volume_breakdown` dict to frontend. Enhanced `formatVolumeSize()` in activity.html to display tooltip on hover showing individual volume sizes (e.g., "cache: 500 MB\nhome: 1.2 GB\nworkspace: 3.5 GB"). Volume size displays dotted underline to indicate tooltip availability. Volume names are dynamically extracted from Docker - any extra user volumes are automatically included

82. **Task - Simplify Activity column header**: Removed retention period from column title<br>
    **Result**: Changed Activity column header from "Activity (7 days)" to just "Activity" in activity.html

83. **Task - Activity monitor half-life to 72h (3 days)**: Extended decay half-life for smoother scoring<br>
    **Result**: Updated JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_HALF_LIFE default from 48h to 72h across Dockerfile, custom_handlers.py, activity_sampler.py, settings_dictionary.yml, README.md, and docs/activity-tracking-methodology.md. Added rationale section explaining why 72h: decay applies to wall-clock time, not working time. A user working 8h/day is active only 1/3 of each 24h period - with 72h calendar half-life, ~24 working hours (3 days × 8h) have 50% weight, effectively calibrating decay to one full workday of engagement. This prevents overnight breaks from aggressively penalizing scores

84. **Task - Half-life simulation tables**: Added detailed simulation results to documentation<br>
    **Result**: Ran Python simulation for different work patterns (10h, 8h, 4h per day) across calendar half-lives (24h-168h). Added three tables to docs/activity-tracking-methodology.md showing "Work Hours at 50%" and "Work Days at 50%" for each combination. Key finding: 72h calendar half-life consistently yields ~2.9 work days at 50% point regardless of daily work hours. Activity scores correctly reflect work fraction (10h=41.6%, 8h=33.3%, 4h=16.6%)

85. **Task - Configured vs Effective half-life documentation**: Rewrote simulation section with clearer explanation<br>
    **Result**: Replaced multiple tables with single effective half-life table showing work patterns (12h, 10h, 8h, 6h, 4h, 2h) vs configured half-lives (24h, 48h, 72h). Added explanation that difference is NOT about sampling but about: (1) decay is continuous 24/7, (2) work is sparse, (3) decay continues during overnight breaks. Added example showing overnight decay: 16h sleep causes ~15% weight loss. Key insight: 72h configured = 18h effective for 8h/day worker (~2.25 work days)

86. **Task - Activity score normalization with TARGET_HOURS**: Added configurable normalization for activity progress bar<br>
    **Result**: Added `JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_TARGET_HOURS` env var (default 8) to Dockerfile, settings_dictionary.yml, and jupyterhub_config.py template_vars. Updated `renderActivityBar()` in activity.html to normalize raw score: `normalized = raw_score / (target_hours / 24)`. For 8h/day target, a raw 33% score (8h/24h) becomes 100% normalized. Progress bar capped at 5 segments (100%) but tooltip shows real percentage - if >100%, displays "(>8h/day)". This allows users working more than target to see their actual activity level while keeping the bar visually bounded

87. **Task - Minimum data requirement and methodology documentation**: Added 24h data threshold for activity percentage and rewrote documentation<br>
    **Result**: **Minimum Data Threshold**: Added `JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_SAMPLE_INTERVAL` to template_vars in jupyterhub_config.py for frontend access. Modified `renderActivityBar(rawScore, sampleCount)` in activity.html to calculate `minSamplesFor24h = 86400 / sampleInterval` (144 samples at 10-minute intervals). If `sampleCount < minSamplesFor24h`, tooltip shows "Not enough data (Nh of 24h collected)" instead of percentage - prevents misleading scores from incomplete data. Progress bar still renders based on current data to show emerging trend, but users are clearly informed the percentage isn't reliable yet. **Methodology Documentation**: Completely rewrote `docs/activity-tracking-methodology.md` from research document to comprehensive implementation specification. New sections cover: Data Collection (sampling parameters, resource metrics, SQLite storage), Activity Score Calculation (exponential decay formula with λ = ln(2)/half_life, normalization formula normalized_score = raw/(target/24), minimum 24h data requirement), Wall-Clock vs Working Time (table showing overnight decay impact, effective half-life table for 12h/10h/8h/6h/4h/2h work patterns across 24h/48h/72h configured half-lives), User Interface (3-state status indicator green/yellow/red, 5-segment activity bar with color thresholds, sortable table columns), API Endpoints (GET /api/activity response schema, POST /api/activity/reset), Configuration Reference (all 7 ACTIVITYMON env vars with defaults), Implementation Files table, Database Schema (activity_samples table with indexes), Design Rationale explaining "why" for each major design decision (exponential decay, 72h half-life, normalization, 24h minimum)

88. **Task - Column tooltips and Auth column**: Added explanatory tooltips to all column headers and authorization status column<br>
    **Result**: **Column Tooltips**: Added title attributes to all 9 column headers in activity.html explaining each column's purpose (User="JupyterHub username", Status="Server status: green=active, yellow=idle, red=offline", CPU="Current CPU usage of user container", etc.). **Auth Column**: Added new sortable column after User showing NativeAuthenticator authorization status. Backend queries `users_info` table for `is_authorized` field via SQLAlchemy text query with exception handling for non-NativeAuthenticator setups. Frontend displays green checkmark (fa-check) for authorized users, red X (fa-times) for unauthorized. Added `formatAuth()` function and `getSortValue()` handling for `is_authorized` sorting (authorized=1 > not authorized=0). Added `.col-auth` CSS class with 4em width. Updated docs/activity-tracking-methodology.md with Auth column in table columns section, added `is_authorized` to API response schema, noted that all column headers have tooltips

89. **Task - Activity table column fixes**: Fixed Auth column width and Volumes tooltip<br>
    **Result**: Increased `.col-auth` width from 4em to 5em to prevent "Au..." truncation (now matches Status column width). Changed Volumes column tooltip from "Total size of user volumes (home, workspace, cache)" to "Total size of user volumes (hover for breakdown)" since volume names are autodiscovered and shown in cell tooltip

90. **Task - Admin UX improvements**: Added deletion spinner and activity initialization for new users<br>
    **Result**: **Deletion Spinner**: Modified admin.html fetch interceptor to detect DELETE requests to `/api/users/{username}`, show loading modal with "Deleting user {username}..." message, and hide on completion. Refactored `showLoadingSpinner(message)` to accept dynamic text, added `id="loading-modal-text"` to modal for text updates. **Activity Initialization**: Added `initialize_activity_for_user(username)` function in custom_handlers.py that records initial inactive sample (active=False, last_activity=None). Called from `after_insert` listener in jupyterhub_config.py when new user created. New users now show 0% activity bar with "Not enough data" tooltip instead of '--'

91. **Task - Fix Volume Sizes logging and tooltip cleanup**: Fixed invisible VolumeSizeRefresher logs and simplified activity tooltip<br>
    **Result**: **Logging Fix**: Module-level `log = logging.getLogger('jupyterhub.custom_handlers')` doesn't inherit JupyterHub's handlers, causing all VolumeSizeRefresher and Volume Sizes logs to be invisible. Added `_get_logger()` helper function that returns `Application.instance().log` for proper integration. Updated `_fetch_volume_sizes()`, `_refresh_volume_sizes_sync()`, `get_volume_sizes_with_refresh()`, and all `VolumeSizeRefresher` methods to use `_get_logger()`. Added cache validation - empty results no longer overwrite valid cached data (logs warning instead). **Tooltip Cleanup**: Removed "(>8h/day)" suffix from activity tooltip when score exceeds 100% - now shows just "Activity: X%"

92. **Task - Admin volume management button**: Added Manage Volumes button to admin panel for users with stopped servers<br>
    **Result**: Added volume management modal to admin.html with checkboxes for each volume type (home, workspace, cache), warning alert, and confirm button. JavaScript uses MutationObserver to inject database icon button into each user's action cell as React renders them. Finds all `tr.user-row` elements, checks for "Stop Server" button to detect running servers (skips those), extracts username from `span[data-testid="user-name-div-{username}"]`, copies Edit User button classes (`btn btn-light btn-xs`), and appends volume button as last element in actions cell. Button is removed dynamically when server starts (MutationObserver detects DOM changes). Modal shows target username, selection count warning, and spinner during reset. Calls existing `DELETE /api/users/{username}/manage-volumes` endpoint with CSRF token. Admins can reset volumes only for users with stopped servers

93. **Task - README documentation update**: Updated README with admin volume management and volume sizes tracking<br>
    **Result**: Added Admin Volume Management feature to Features list (database icon button in admin panel). Updated Activity Monitor feature description to include volume sizes with per-volume breakdown. Added Volume sizes feature to Activity Monitor Features section with hover tooltip details. Added `JUPYTERHUB_ACTIVITYMON_VOLUMES_UPDATE_INTERVAL` config option (default 1 hour). Added note in User Self-Service Workflow section explaining admin can manage volumes for any user from `/hub/admin`

94. **Task - Fix volume button positioning during React render**: Fixed button appearing on left side until page refresh<br>
    **Result**: MutationObserver fires while React is still rendering, causing volume button to be inserted before React finishes adding other buttons (server control buttons). Button ended up in middle of action cell instead of last. Fixed by repositioning existing button to end on each MutationObserver tick if `actionsCell.lastElementChild !== existingBtn` - ensures button stays at rightmost position regardless of when React renders additional buttons
