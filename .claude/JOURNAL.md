# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - Add Docker badges**: added Docker pulls and GitHub stars badges to README.md<br>
    **Result**: README now displays Docker pulls badge (stellars/stellars-jupyterhub-ds), Docker image size badge, and GitHub stars badge

2. **Task - Project initialization and documentation**: Analyzed codebase and created comprehensive project documentation<br>
    **Result**: Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with detailed architecture overview, configuration patterns, common commands, GPU auto-detection logic, volume management, authentication setup, and troubleshooting guide for future Claude Code instances

3. **Task - Feature planning for user controls**: Designed two self-service features for JupyterHub user control panel<br>
    **Result**: Created `FEATURE_PLAN.md` documenting Reset Home Volume and Restart Server features with implementation details, API handlers, UI templates, JavaScript integration, security considerations, edge cases, testing plans, and rollout strategy

4. **Task - Version management implementation**: Added version tracking and tagging system matching stellars-jupyterlab-ds pattern<br>
    **Result**: Created `project.env` with project metadata and version 1.0.0_jh-4.x, updated `Makefile` with increment_version and tag targets, auto-increment on build, dual-tag push (latest and versioned), leveraging existing Docker socket access for both planned features

5. **Task - Implement user self-service features**: Implemented Reset Home Volume and Restart Server features from FEATURE_PLAN.md<br>
    **Result**: Created custom API handlers in `services/jupyterhub/conf/bin/custom_handlers.py` with ResetHomeVolumeHandler and RestartServerHandler classes, created custom `home.html` template with buttons and confirmation modals, registered handlers in `jupyterhub_config.py` with @admin_or_self permissions, updated Dockerfile to copy templates and handlers, added feature documentation to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - both features use Docker API directly via /var/run/docker.sock for volume management and container restart operations

6. **Task - Enhance and fix self-service features**: Evolved volume management from single home volume to multi-volume selection, fixed Bootstrap 5 compatibility, added visual enhancements<br>
    **Result**: Transformed ResetHomeVolumeHandler into ManageVolumesHandler supporting selective reset of home/workspace/cache volumes via checkboxes in UI, fixed template inheritance to properly extend JupyterHub's default home.html (resolving 404 errors), updated to Bootstrap 5 modal API (data-bs-toggle, data-bs-target, btn-close), wrapped JavaScript in RequireJS callback for proper module loading, added Font Awesome icons (fa-rotate for restart, fa-database for volumes), implemented automatic page refresh after Stop Server/Manage Volumes/Restart Server actions, updated API endpoint to `/api/users/{username}/manage-volumes` accepting JSON body with volume array, backend now processes multiple volumes and returns detailed success/failure response, bumped version to 3.0.12 reflecting major feature enhancement

7. **Task - Document self-service features in README**: Updated README with features section and screenshots demonstrating new self-service capabilities<br>
    **Result**: Added comprehensive Features section with bullet points covering GPU auto-detection, user self-service, isolated environments, native authentication, shared storage, and production-ready setup, created Self-Service Volume Management subsection with three screenshots (restart server button, manage volumes button, volume selection modal) and one-sentence descriptions for each, positioned visual documentation prominently after feature list to demonstrate user-facing functionality

8. **Task - Production readiness and CI/CD setup**: Implemented visual enhancements, GitHub Actions workflow, architecture documentation, and resolved critical production issues<br>
    **Result**: Added Font Awesome icons to all control buttons (fa-stop, fa-play, fa-rotate, fa-database), implemented MutationObserver for auto page refresh after server stop with icon re-injection before refresh, created GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for Dockerfile validation with hadolint, pinned JupyterHub base image to version 5.4.2 (resolved DL3007 warning), reorganized README with mermaid architecture diagram showing Traefik -> Hub -> Spawner -> User containers flow with transparent background for dark mode compatibility, removed Claude co-authoring from entire git history (95 commits rewritten), fixed critical ModuleNotFoundError by adding /srv/jupyterhub to sys.path in config, built jupyterhub_config.py into Docker image by default (changed build context to project root, image now self-contained and works out-of-box), added pull_policy: build to prevent Docker Compose from pulling image after local build, created release tags STABLE_3.0.23 and RELEASE_3.0.23, version progression 3.0.20 -> 3.0.23 reflecting stability and production readiness improvements

9. **Task - Privileged user docker.sock access**: Implemented group-based access control for Docker socket mounting in user containers<br>
    **Result**: Created built-in protected group system with `docker-privileged` as single source of truth in config/jupyterhub_config.py::BUILTIN_GROUPS, implemented pre_spawn_hook to check group membership and conditionally mount /var/run/docker.sock with rw permissions, created startup script 02_ensure_groups.py that reads BUILTIN_GROUPS from config and creates missing groups before JupyterHub starts (follows DRY principle), added runtime protection in pre_spawn_hook to recreate groups if deleted, group cannot be permanently removed - auto-recreates on startup and before every container spawn, updated documentation in README and CLAUDE.md with security warnings about root-level host access, added instructions for admins to manage group membership through JupyterHub admin panel at /hub/admin, created four slash commands for common workflows: /build (verbose image build), /start (background compose up with log monitoring), /stop (make clean with orphan removal), /publish (journal update, rich commit, git push), bumped version to 3.1.2 reflecting new privileged access control feature

10. **Task - Notification broadcast system**: Implemented admin-only notification broadcast to all active JupyterLab servers with jupyterlab_notifications_extension integration<br>
    **Result**: Created BroadcastNotificationHandler and NotificationsPageHandler in custom_handlers.py for admin-only access at /hub/notifications, implemented concurrent notification delivery using asyncio.gather() with 5-second timeout per server, added temporary API token generation (5-minute expiry) for server authentication, created notifications.html template with message input (140 char limit), type selector (default/info/success/warning/error/in-progress), auto-close toggle, and live character counter, dynamically constructs endpoint URLs using spawner.server.base_url for correct routing, sends notifications to /jupyterlab-notifications-extension/ingest with proper payload format (type field not variant, actions array with Dismiss button), implemented comprehensive error handling for connection timeouts, auth failures, missing extensions with user-friendly messages, added one-line logging per server showing username, message preview, notification type, and outcome (SUCCESS/FAILED/ERROR), registered handlers in jupyterhub_config.py extra_handlers, updated CLAUDE.md and README.md with detailed feature documentation, added navigation link on home page for admin access, resolved Docker build cache issues requiring --no-cache flag to properly include new handlers, bumped version to 3.2.0 reflecting major notification broadcast feature

11. **Task - Documentation and screenshots**: Created minimal documentation for notification system, UI customization, and Docker socket permissions following super-minimal modus primaris style<br>
    **Result**: Created doc/notifications.md (35 lines - key technical facts, handler implementation, dependencies, error handling), doc/ui-template-customization.md (55 lines - JavaScript patterns, Bootstrap 5 syntax, CSRF protection, build process), doc/docker-socket-permissions.md (66 lines - pre-spawn hook implementation, built-in group system, security implications), updated README.md User Interface section replacing screenshot-restart-server.png with screenshot-home.png showing complete user control panel and adding screenshot-send-notification.png displaying admin notification broadcast interface, refreshed .claude/CLAUDE.md with accurate notification system technical details (140 char limit, all 6 notification types, temporary token generation with 5-minute expiry, correct endpoint URL pattern with base_url interpolation, hyphenated extension path, Dismiss button feature, HTTP 500 error handling, one-line logging details), all documentation simplified to "glimpse of implementation" with essential bullet points and code snippets absent of lengthy narrative

12. **Task - Configuration-agnostic volume management with optional descriptions**: Refactored volume management to dynamically read from configuration and added optional volume descriptions<br>
    **Result**: Modified jupyterhub_config.py to define DOCKER_SPAWNER_VOLUMES as module-level constant, created get_user_volume_suffixes() function extracting volume suffixes matching jupyterlab-{username}_<suffix> pattern, added USER_VOLUME_SUFFIXES calculated from DOCKER_SPAWNER_VOLUMES (importable by handlers), protected all c.* assignments with 'if c is not None:' guards to allow module import without NameError, added optional VOLUME_DESCRIPTIONS dict mapping volume suffixes to user-friendly descriptions, exposed volume_descriptions via c.JupyterHub.template_vars, updated home.html template to use Jinja2 loop generating checkboxes dynamically from user_volume_suffixes with conditional description display, modified ManageVolumesHandler to validate against USER_VOLUME_SUFFIXES from config instead of hardcoded set, simplified README.md following modus primaris (features first, simplified notification description, simplified architecture diagram labels), updated documentation in .claude/CLAUDE.md (Manage Volumes section with configuration example, simplified Restart Server section) and doc/ui-template-customization.md (added template variables section), UI now fully agnostic working correctly if volumes renamed/added/removed in configuration without template or handler changes

13. **Task - Release v3.2.11 preparation and documentation refinement**: Tagged release, prepared delta notes, simplified documentation, corrected security warnings<br>
    **Result**: Created git tag RELEASE_3.2.11 with annotations covering configuration-agnostic volume management, notification broadcast, privileged access control, created RELEASE.md delta release notes documenting major features (configuration-agnostic volume management with optional descriptions, admin notification broadcast with 6 types, privileged user docker.sock access control), technical improvements (module-level constants, dynamic handlers/templates), documentation updates (modus primaris style, new screenshots), version history (v3.2.11 ← v3.2.0 ← v3.1.2 ← v3.0.23 ← v3.0.14), upgrade notes with backward compatibility, simplified doc/docker-socket-permissions.md from 66 to 19 lines removing verbose explanations/use cases/auditing commands, updated project.env with RELEASE_TAG and RELEASE_DATE metadata, corrected docker.sock security warnings changing "host system" to "Docker host" (docker.sock grants Docker daemon access not physical host), applied HTML alert styling (alert-block alert-warning) to security warnings in README.md for better visibility, updated security warnings in README.md (Requirements and Privileged Access sections), doc/docker-socket-permissions.md, and .claude/CLAUDE.md

14. **Task - Configuration flow and UI workflow diagrams**: created mermaid diagrams illustrating settings interaction and user self-service workflows<br>
    **Result**: added Configuration Flow section to README after Architecture section showing how environment variables in compose.yml (ADMIN, NOTEBOOK_IMAGE, NETWORK, GPU, SSL, MLFLOW, GLANCES, TENSORBOARD) flow through jupyterhub_config.py (AUTH, SPAWN, VOLS, HOOK) to spawned user containers (LAB, MLFLOW, GLANCES, TENSORBOARD, GPUACCESS), three-layer graph with amber/green/blue color scheme indicating configuration source, processing layer, and runtime services, removed fill colors from shapes (stroke-only styling), restructured ENABLE_SERVICE_* as horizontal subgraph showing MLflow/Glances/TensorBoard as examples passed to Lab env, expanded CONFIG section to include DOCKER_SPAWNER_VOLUMES, VOLUME_DESCRIPTIONS, BUILTIN_GROUPS, pre_spawn_hook, extra_handlers (ManageVolumes/RestartServer/Notifications), template_paths, DOCKER_NOTEBOOK_DIR, added JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL, TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL, NVIDIA_AUTODETECT_IMAGE to ENV section, consolidated RUNTIME section showing Services controlled by ENABLE_SERVICE_* env vars, created separate GPU Auto-Detection section with flowchart diagram showing decision logic (ENABLE_GPU_SUPPORT values 0/1/2), auto-detect mechanism spawning temporary nvidia/cuda container running nvidia-smi, success/failure paths setting NVIDIA_DETECTED flag, cleanup of test container jupyterhub_nvidia_autodetect, and final application of device_requests to spawned containers, created User Self-Service Workflow diagram showing home page UI states (server running vs stopped), custom buttons (Restart Server with fa-rotate icon, Manage Volumes with fa-database icon), modal interface with checkboxes and optional descriptions, API handlers (RestartServerHandler, ManageVolumesHandler) with @admin_or_self permissions, Docker operations (container.restart, spawner.stop, volume.remove, spawner.start), AJAX requests (POST for restart, DELETE for volume management with JSON payload), auto page refresh via MutationObserver after successful operations, created Volume Architecture diagram showing multi-user deployment with two example users (user1, user2) each having three dedicated volumes (home, workspace, cache) mounted at /home, /home/lab/workspace, /home/lab/.cache respectively, single jupyterhub_shared volume represented as shared resource mounted at /mnt/shared accessible from all user containers, improved arrow alignment by repositioning MSHARED node between HOST and CONTAINER subgraphs with solid arrow from VOLSHARED emphasizing direct mount relationship and dashed arrows to containers showing accessibility, added note explaining users can selectively reset personal volumes (home/workspace/cache) through Manage Volumes when server stopped but shared volume protected from individual user reset, converted HTML alert divs to GitHub-style WARNING blocks (two instances in README)

15. **Task - Update watchtower image**: Replaced deprecated watchtower image with maintained fork<br>
    **Result**: Changed watchtower image from containrrr/watchtower:latest to nickfedor/watchtower:latest in compose.yml, new image is actively maintained and compatible with latest Docker versions, bumped version to 3.3.1

16. **Task - Cleanup startup scripts**: Removed obsolete nvidia-smi script and renumbered ensure_groups<br>
    **Result**: Deleted 01_nvidia-smi.sh (GPU detection now uses separate nvidia/cuda container spawned by jupyterhub_config.py), renamed 02_ensure_groups.py to 01_ensure_groups.py for sequential ordering, bumped version to 3.3.2

17. **Task - Fix Watchtower refresh frequency**: Investigated and fixed Watchtower scheduling issues<br>
    **Result**: Removed unsupported `--no-startup` flag (caused crash), fixed cron expression from 5-field `0 0 * * *` to 6-field `0 0 0 * * *` (watchtower uses seconds) - was running hourly instead of daily at midnight UTC

18. **Task - Refactor Docker access control groups**: Split into two groups with distinct purposes<br>
    **Result**: Renamed `docker-privileged` to `docker-sock` (mounts docker.sock), created new `docker-privileged` (runs with --privileged flag). Updated pre_spawn_hook to check both groups and set spawner.volumes or spawner.privileged accordingly. Updated README.md, doc/docker-socket-permissions.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md with new group documentation

19. **Task - Fix privileged container mode**: DockerSpawner privileged flag not working<br>
    **Result**: Changed from `spawner.privileged = True` to `spawner.extra_host_config['privileged'] = True` - DockerSpawner requires extra_host_config dict for host configuration options. Bumped version to 3.4.1

20. **Task - Exclude watchtower from self-updates**: Prevent watchtower from updating itself<br>
    **Result**: Added `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false` label to watchtower service in compose.yml - legacy namespace kept by forks for backward compatibility

21. **Task - Traefik host-based routing template**: Created deployment template for local Traefik with self-signed certificates<br>
    **Result**: Added `extra/traefik-host-based-routing/` template for creating `<name>_stellars_jupyterhub_ds` deployments with local Traefik reverse proxy (ports 80/443), self-signed wildcard certificates, and HTTP->HTTPS redirect. Includes compose_override.yml with YOURDOMAIN placeholder, Makefile (start/stop/pull/logs/status), start.sh (clone/pull + start), stop.sh, generate-certs.sh (creates wildcard cert and tls.yml for given domain), .gitignore (excludes certs and cloned repo). Updated extra/README.md with template listing

22. **Task - Fix root path base URL redirect**: Fixed double-slash issue when JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL=/<br>
    **Result**: Added `JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL_PREFIX` normalization in `config/jupyterhub_config.py`. When `JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL` is `/`, `''`, or `None`, prefix becomes empty string. Updated three URL concatenations (default_url, hub_connect_url, base_url) to use prefix instead of raw BASE_URL. Prevents browser interpreting `//hub/home` as protocol-relative URL pointing to host `hub`

23. **Task - Update traefik-host-based-routing template**: Refactored deployment template for root path routing<br>
    **Result**: Removed Makefile from `extra/traefik-host-based-routing/`. Updated `compose_override.yml` with `JUPYTERHUB_BASE_URL=/` and root path Traefik routing. Updated `start.sh` to pull images and use `--no-build`. Updated README to reflect simplified workflow without Makefile

24. **Task - User rename with authorization preservation**: Implemented admin API to rename users while preserving NativeAuthenticator authorization<br>
    **Result**: Created `RenameUserHandler` in `custom_handlers.py` with PATCH `/hub/api/users/{username}/rename` endpoint. Handler updates both JupyterHub `User` and NativeAuthenticator `UserInfo` tables atomically, preserving `is_authorized` status. Requires admin privileges and stopped server. Includes validation (name uniqueness, server state), rollback on failure, and detailed logging. Registered handler in `jupyterhub_config.py`. Added Admin Features section to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` documenting the problem (UserInfo not synced on rename), solution (atomic update of both tables), and API contract

25. **Task - Fix NativeAuthenticator sync on rename**: Replaced broken handler approach with SQLAlchemy event listener<br>
    **Result**: Discovered `extra_handlers` appends to default handlers (doesn't override), so `SyncedUserAPIHandler` was never called. Implemented SQLAlchemy `@event.listens_for(orm.User.name, 'set')` in `jupyterhub_config.py` to intercept ALL User.name changes at ORM level. Removed `SyncedUserAPIHandler` and `RenameUserHandler` classes from `custom_handlers.py`. Removed corresponding routes from `extra_handlers`. Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md` replacing "Admin Features > Rename User" with simpler "NativeAuthenticator Sync" note. New approach catches renames from admin panel, API, and any other source automatically

26. **Task - Version display in browser console**: Added version badge to browser JavaScript console<br>
    **Result**: Added `ARG VERSION=dev` and `ENV STELLARS_JUPYTERHUB_VERSION=${VERSION}` to Dockerfile. Updated `compose.yml` build args to pass `VERSION=${VERSION:-dev}`. Updated `scripts/build.sh` and `scripts/build_verbose.sh` to source `project.env` and export VERSION. Added `stellars_version` template variable in `jupyterhub_config.py`. Added styled console.log in `home.html` displaying blue "Stellars JupyterHub DS" + green version badge in browser console

27. **Task - Admin user creation with credentials modal**: Implemented auto-generation of passwords when admin creates users via admin panel<br>
    **Result**: Added `after_insert` SQLAlchemy event listener in `jupyterhub_config.py` to auto-create NativeAuthenticator UserInfo with memorable 3-word password (e.g., storm-apple-ocean) and `is_authorized=1` (auto-approved). Added `after_delete` listener to clean up UserInfo when user deleted. Created password cache in `custom_handlers.py` with 5-minute expiry for secure credential handoff. Added `GetUserCredentialsHandler` API at `/api/users/credentials` for admin retrieval. Created `templates_enhanced/` directory with customized templates - enhanced `admin.html` with fetch interceptor to detect user creation, credentials modal with copy/download functionality, enhanced `page.html` with NativeAuth nav items (Change Password, Authorize Users). Fixed Dockerfile to copy from `templates_enhanced/` instead of `templates/`. Fixed fetch interceptor to handle URL objects (React passes URL object, not string). Changed version console.log to plain text format

28. **Task - Fix admin template URL handling**: Fixed fetch interceptor and nav links in templates_enhanced<br>
    **Result**: Fixed `isUserCreation` check in admin.html to strip query params (`?_xsrf=...`) before checking if URL ends with `api/users` - React admin adds XSRF token as query param which broke the endpoint detection. Fixed double "hub" prefix in page.html nav links - changed `{{ base_url }}hub/authorize` to `{{ base_url }}authorize` and `{{ base_url }}hub/change-password` to `{{ base_url }}change-password` since base_url already includes `/hub/`

29. **Task - Fix credentials API route conflict**: Changed credentials endpoint from `/api/users/credentials` to `/api/admin/credentials`<br>
    **Result**: JupyterHub's built-in `/api/users/*` handler was catching requests before custom handler, returning "Invalid JSON keys" error. Changed route in jupyterhub_config.py, admin.html, and custom_handlers.py docstring

30. **Task - Credentials modal UX improvements**: Enhanced modal layout, scrolling, and loading feedback<br>
    **Result**: Moved Copy/Download buttons to top of modal body. Added scrollable container (max-height 300px) for long user lists. Removed `<code>` styling for plain text display. Added loading spinner modal shown between user creation and credentials display. Improved Makefile version output format to show "Current version" and "New version" lines

31. **Task - Fix password storage and enable bake**: Fixed NativeAuthenticator password storage format and Docker build configuration<br>
    **Result**: Changed password storage from decoded string to bytes - bcrypt.hashpw() returns bytes which NativeAuthenticator ORM expects as LargeBinary. Previous string storage caused "argument 'salt': 'str' object cannot be converted to 'PyBytes'" error on login. Enabled COMPOSE_BAKE=true in build.sh, build_verbose.sh, and .claude/commands/build.md to use Docker's bake builder (removes deprecation warning). Tagged STABLE_3.5.10

32. **Task - Per-row copy icon in credentials modal**: Added individual copy functionality for each credential row<br>
    **Result**: Added third column with subtle copy icon (40% opacity) for each row in credentials table. Click handler copies "Username: xxx\nPassword: yyy" to clipboard. Icon changes to checkmark briefly (1.5s) after successful copy, then returns to copy icon

33. **Task - Comment out console logs**: Removed debug console output from admin template<br>
    **Result**: Commented out all console.log and console.error statements in admin.html (11 total) - fetch interceptor logs, user creation detection, credentials fetch/receive, error handlers. Version display in home.html remains active as only console output

34. **Task - Comprehensive UI styling enhancements**: Extended custom.css with consistent styling across all JupyterHub pages<br>
    **Result**: Added notifications page styling (form container, textarea, character counter, results section with banded table, status badges), removed obtrusive hover highlight on admin user rows (replaced with subtle 0.003 alpha effect), set collapsed user card padding to 0 to override inline styles, unified button font sizes to 0.8rem across all pages (authorization buttons, token revoke, admin actions, collapse buttons, toggle details), added Add Users form panel styling (labels, textarea, submit button, dark mode support), disabled hover on expanded card tables via box-shadow override, added groups page styling (list items, card footer, badges), styled collapse/expand buttons (0.2rem 0.3rem padding), added username label spacing, dark mode Add Users button with explicit colors (#f8f9fa bg, #6c757d border)

35. **Task - Traefik template start.sh --refresh flag**: Added optional refresh flag to start.sh for pulling latest upstream<br>
    **Result**: Modified extra/traefik-host-based-routing/start.sh to clone repo only once on first run, skip git operations if repo exists (just uses existing), added --refresh flag to pull latest from origin/main when explicitly requested

36. **Task - Volume renamer script**: Created extra/volume-renamer with script for renaming Docker volumes between users<br>
    **Result**: Created rename-user-volumes.sh - renames all jupyterlab-* volumes from source pattern to target username, handles Docker's dot-to-hex encoding (. becomes -2e), supports --dry-run (show mappings without changes) and --keep-orig (preserve source volumes), compact help with generic examples (oldnick -> first.last)

37. **Task - UI refinements and icon cleanup**: Admin panel styling and password toggle icon improvements<br>
    **Result**: Aligned admin action buttons to right (td.actions text-align), added transparent background for dark mode .server-dashboard-container, made table hover nearly invisible (--bs-table-hover-bg: rgba 0.003), replaced eye emoji with Font Awesome icons (fa-eye/fa-eye-slash) in all 4 password templates (signup, login, change-password, change-password-admin) - both button HTML and JavaScript toggle

38. **Task - Table hover and README update**: Fixed Bootstrap table-hover styling and documented mnemonic passwords feature<br>
    **Result**: Added --bs-table-accent-bg override for Bootstrap 5 table-hover (two-step variable process), reduced Shutdown Hub button margin from 30px to 5px, removed color override from dark mode .server-dashboard-container, updated README Features with admin user creation and mnemonic passwords (e.g., storm-apple-ocean)

39. **Task - Authorization page improvements**: Protected users with accounts from accidental discard<br>
    **Result**: Added JavaScript to authorization-area.html that fetches /api/users and hides Discard buttons for usernames that exist in JupyterHub (initial custom handler approach failed - NativeAuthenticator handlers take precedence over extra_handlers), removed unused AuthorizationAreaHandler from config and custom_handlers.py, made authorization table compact with CSS for .authorization-container, fixed 403 error by adding X-XSRFToken header and credentials to fetch request

40. **Task - Fix table hover color override**: Admin panel table hover color not being overridden despite CSS<br>
    **Result**: Discovered Bootstrap 5 table-hover targets td/th cells specifically while our CSS used universal `> *` selector. Fixed by changing selectors to explicitly target `> td, > th` and using `transparent` instead of CSS variables. Updated three rule sets: table-hover override (lines 1055-1061), user-row hover (lines 1086-1092), and dark mode user-row hover (lines 1364-1370)

41. **Task - Server-side authorization discard fix**: Replaced clunky JavaScript API call with server-side Jinja2 logic<br>
    **Result**: Created StellarsNativeAuthenticator subclass that overrides get_handlers() to inject CustomAuthorizationAreaHandler, which passes hub_usernames set to template. Updated authorization-area.html to use `{% if user.username not in hub_usernames %}` instead of JavaScript fetch. Removes API call, XSRF token handling, and flash of Discard buttons before hiding

42. **Task - Custom logo support**: Added JUPYTERHUB_LOGO_FILE configuration for custom branding<br>
    **Result**: Added logo_file config that checks for file at /srv/jupyterhub/logo.svg (or JUPYTERHUB_LOGO_FILE env var), JupyterHub serves it at {{ base_url }}logo automatically. Fixed CustomAuthorizationAreaHandler 403 by adding @needs_scope('admin:users') decorator and importing orm inside get() method. Simplified page.html logo block to always use base_url/logo

43. **Task - Enhance certs-installer scripts**: Added optional folder parameter and help option<br>
    **Result**: Updated install_cert.sh and install_cert.bat to accept optional directory argument (default: current directory), added -h/--help/? flags showing usage, supported file types, and examples. Both scripts now display which directory is being scanned

44. **Task - Fix volume reset encoding**: Fixed Docker volume/container name encoding for special characters<br>
    **Result**: Added encode_username_for_docker() function using escapism library (same as DockerSpawner) to ensure compatibility with JupyterHub's naming scheme. Updated ManageVolumesHandler (line 152), RestartServerHandler (line 227), and BroadcastNotificationHandler (line 454) to use encoded usernames. Handles special characters like `.` -> `-2e`, `@` -> `-40` matching JupyterHub's default encoding

45. **Task - Selective notification recipients**: Enhanced notification broadcast to allow targeting specific servers<br>
    **Result**: Added ActiveServersHandler (`GET /api/notifications/active-servers`) to list active servers. Modified BroadcastNotificationHandler to accept optional `recipients` array - filters to selected users if provided, sends to all if omitted (backward compatible). Updated notifications.html with "Send to all active servers" checkbox, server selection list with Select All/Deselect All buttons, dynamic button text showing recipient count. Validation prevents sending with no recipients selected

46. **Task - Idle server culler**: Implemented automatic shutdown of inactive servers<br>
    **Result**: Added jupyterhub-idle-culler package to Dockerfile. Added configuration with environment variables: IDLE_CULLER_ENABLED (default 0), IDLE_CULLER_TIMEOUT (default 86400s/24h), IDLE_CULLER_CULL_EVERY (default 600s/10min), IDLE_CULLER_MAX_AGE (default 0/unlimited). Service runs as managed JupyterHub service with role-based scopes. Disabled by default, opt-in via IDLE_CULLER_ENABLED=1. Bumped version to 3.6.0

47. **Task - Standardize env vars with JUPYTERHUB_ prefix**: Renamed all environment variables to use consistent JUPYTERHUB_ prefix and added admin Settings page<br>
    **Result**: Renamed 13 environment variables (ENABLE_GPU_SUPPORT->JUPYTERHUB_GPU_ENABLED, ENABLE_JUPYTERHUB_SSL->JUPYTERHUB_SSL_ENABLED, ENABLE_SERVICE_*->JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_*, ENABLE_SIGNUP->JUPYTERHUB_SIGNUP_ENABLED, DOCKER_NOTEBOOK_IMAGE->JUPYTERHUB_NOTEBOOK_IMAGE, DOCKER_NETWORK_NAME->JUPYTERHUB_NETWORK_NAME, NVIDIA_AUTODETECT_IMAGE->JUPYTERHUB_NVIDIA_IMAGE, IDLE_CULLER_*->JUPYTERHUB_IDLE_CULLER_*). Created SettingsPageHandler with admin-only access at /settings showing read-only banded table of all configuration values. Updated compose.yml, jupyterhub_config.py, custom_handlers.py, README.md, CLAUDE.md. Added Settings link to admin navbar. No backward compatibility for old names. Bumped version to 3.6.1

48. **Task - Settings dictionary YAML**: Externalized settings metadata to config/settings_dictionary.yml<br>
    **Result**: Created settings_dictionary.yml with categories as top-level keys (JupyterHub Core, Docker Spawner, GPU, Services, Idle Culler, Branding), each containing list of settings with name, description, default, and optional empty_display. Updated SettingsPageHandler to load from YAML instead of hardcoded values. Added pyyaml to Dockerfile pip install. Dockerfile now copies settings_dictionary.yml to /srv/jupyterhub/

49. **Task - xkcdpass password generation**: Replaced custom word list with xkcdpass library for auto-generated passwords<br>
    **Result**: Moved settings_dictionary.yml to services/jupyterhub/conf/ for proper image baking. Replaced hardcoded word list with xkcdpass library for memorable password generation. Added configurable env vars: JUPYTERHUB_AUTOGENERATED_PASSWORD_WORDS (default 4) and JUPYTERHUB_AUTOGENERATED_PASSWORD_DELIMITER (default "-"). Added xkcdpass to Dockerfile pip install. Fixed ENABLE_SIGNUP to JUPYTERHUB_SIGNUP_ENABLED in Dockerfile defaults

50. **Task - Cleanup templates directory structure**: Removed redundant HTML files and renamed directory for clarity<br>
    **Result**: Removed unused *.html files from services/jupyterhub/templates/ (only certs/ subdirectory needed). Renamed templates_enhanced to html_templates_enhanced for clearer naming. Updated Dockerfile COPY paths accordingly

51. **Task - Version footer on home page**: Added version status bar to home page matching admin page style<br>
    **Result**: Added `{% block footer %}` to home.html displaying "Stellars JupyterHub DS X.Y.Z | JupyterHub X.Y.Z". Uses `stellars_version.split('_')[0]` to show only major.minor.patch (strips _jh-x.x suffix). Added `<div class="mt-5 pt-5"></div>` spacer before footer for visual separation from content. Uses `server_version` template variable for JupyterHub version

52. **Task - Fix server_version not populated**: Investigated and fixed missing JupyterHub version in home page footer<br>
    **Result**: Discovered `AdminHandler` explicitly passes `server_version` to admin.html but `HomeHandler` does not pass it to home.html - it's handler-specific, not global. Added `jupyterhub.__version__` to `c.JupyterHub.template_vars` in jupyterhub_config.py making `server_version` available globally to all templates

53. **Task - Create stop.sh script**: Added stop.sh to complement start.sh for platform shutdown<br>
    **Result**: Created stop.sh mirroring start.sh pattern - resolves script location via readlink/dirname, respects compose_override.yml if present, runs docker compose down --remove-orphans
