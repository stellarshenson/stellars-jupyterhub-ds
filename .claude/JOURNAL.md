# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

---

1. **Task - Add Docker badges**: added Docker pulls and GitHub stars badges to README.md<br>
    **Result**: README now displays Docker pulls badge (stellars/stellars-jupyterhub-ds), Docker image size badge, and GitHub stars badge

2. **Task - Project initialization and documentation**: Analyzed codebase and created comprehensive project documentation<br>
    **Result**: Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with detailed architecture overview, configuration patterns, common commands, GPU auto-detection logic, volume management, authentication setup, and troubleshooting guide for future Claude Code instances

3. **Task - Feature planning for user controls**: Designed two self-service features for JupyterHub user control panel<br>
    **Result**: Created `FEATURE_PLAN.md` documenting Reset Home Volume and Restart Server features with implementation details, API handlers, UI templates, JavaScript integration, security considerations, edge cases, testing plans, and rollout strategy

4. **Task - Version management implementation**: Added version tracking and tagging system matching stellars-jupyterlab-ds pattern<br>
    **Result**: Created `project.env` with project metadata and version 1.0.0_jh-4.x, updated `Makefile` with increment_version and tag targets, auto-increment on build, dual-tag push (latest and versioned), leveraging existing Docker socket access for both planned features

5. **Task - Implement user self-service features**: Implemented Reset Home Volume and Restart Server features from FEATURE_PLAN.md<br>
    **Result**: Created custom API handlers in `services/jupyterhub/conf/bin/custom_handlers.py` with ResetHomeVolumeHandler and RestartServerHandler classes, created custom `home.html` template with buttons and confirmation modals, registered handlers in `jupyterhub_config.py` with @admin_or_self permissions, updated Dockerfile to copy templates and handlers, added feature documentation to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - both features use Docker API directly via /var/run/docker.sock for volume management and container restart operations

6. **Task - Enhance and fix self-service features**: Evolved volume management from single home volume to multi-volume selection, fixed Bootstrap 5 compatibility, added visual enhancements<br>
    **Result**: Transformed ResetHomeVolumeHandler into ManageVolumesHandler supporting selective reset of home/workspace/cache volumes via checkboxes in UI, fixed template inheritance to properly extend JupyterHub's default home.html (resolving 404 errors), updated to Bootstrap 5 modal API (data-bs-toggle, data-bs-target, btn-close), wrapped JavaScript in RequireJS callback for proper module loading, added Font Awesome icons (fa-rotate for restart, fa-database for volumes), implemented automatic page refresh after Stop Server/Manage Volumes/Restart Server actions, updated API endpoint to `/api/users/{username}/manage-volumes` accepting JSON body with volume array, backend now processes multiple volumes and returns detailed success/failure response, bumped version to 3.0.12 reflecting major feature enhancement

7. **Task - Document self-service features in README**: Updated README with features section and screenshots demonstrating new self-service capabilities<br>
    **Result**: Added comprehensive Features section with bullet points covering GPU auto-detection, user self-service, isolated environments, native authentication, shared storage, and production-ready setup, created Self-Service Volume Management subsection with three screenshots (restart server button, manage volumes button, volume selection modal) and one-sentence descriptions for each, positioned visual documentation prominently after feature list to demonstrate user-facing functionality

8. **Task - Production readiness and CI/CD setup**: Implemented visual enhancements, GitHub Actions workflow, architecture documentation, and resolved critical production issues<br>
    **Result**: Added Font Awesome icons to all control buttons (fa-stop, fa-play, fa-rotate, fa-database), implemented MutationObserver for auto page refresh after server stop with icon re-injection before refresh, created GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for Dockerfile validation with hadolint, pinned JupyterHub base image to version 5.4.2 (resolved DL3007 warning), reorganized README with mermaid architecture diagram showing Traefik -> Hub -> Spawner -> User containers flow with transparent background for dark mode compatibility, removed Claude co-authoring from entire git history (95 commits rewritten), fixed critical ModuleNotFoundError by adding /srv/jupyterhub to sys.path in config, built jupyterhub_config.py into Docker image by default (changed build context to project root, image now self-contained and works out-of-box), added pull_policy: build to prevent Docker Compose from pulling image after local build, created release tags STABLE_3.0.23 and RELEASE_3.0.23, version progression 3.0.20 -> 3.0.23 reflecting stability and production readiness improvements

9. **Task - Privileged user docker.sock access**: Implemented group-based access control for Docker socket mounting in user containers<br>
    **Result**: Created built-in protected group system with `docker-privileged` as single source of truth in config/jupyterhub_config.py::BUILTIN_GROUPS, implemented pre_spawn_hook to check group membership and conditionally mount /var/run/docker.sock with rw permissions, created startup script 02_ensure_groups.py that reads BUILTIN_GROUPS from config and creates missing groups before JupyterHub starts (follows DRY principle), added runtime protection in pre_spawn_hook to recreate groups if deleted, group cannot be permanently removed - auto-recreates on startup and before every container spawn, updated documentation in README and CLAUDE.md with security warnings about root-level host access, added instructions for admins to manage group membership through JupyterHub admin panel at /hub/admin, created four slash commands for common workflows: /build (verbose image build), /start (background compose up with log monitoring), /stop (make clean with orphan removal), /publish (journal update, rich commit, git push), bumped version to 3.1.2 reflecting new privileged access control feature

10. **Task - Notification broadcast system**: Implemented admin-only notification broadcast to all active JupyterLab servers with jupyterlab_notifications_extension integration<br>
    **Result**: Created BroadcastNotificationHandler and NotificationsPageHandler in custom_handlers.py for admin-only access at /hub/notifications, implemented concurrent notification delivery using asyncio.gather() with 5-second timeout per server, added temporary API token generation (5-minute expiry) for server authentication, created notifications.html template with message input (140 char limit), type selector (default/info/success/warning/error/in-progress), auto-close toggle, and live character counter, dynamically constructs endpoint URLs using spawner.server.base_url for correct routing, sends notifications to /jupyterlab-notifications-extension/ingest with proper payload format (type field not variant, actions array with Dismiss button), implemented comprehensive error handling for connection timeouts, auth failures, missing extensions with user-friendly messages, added one-line logging per server showing username, message preview, notification type, and outcome (SUCCESS/FAILED/ERROR), registered handlers in jupyterhub_config.py extra_handlers, updated CLAUDE.md and README.md with detailed feature documentation, added navigation link on home page for admin access, resolved Docker build cache issues requiring --no-cache flag to properly include new handlers, bumped version to 3.2.0 reflecting major notification broadcast feature
